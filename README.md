# Gasomaton

EXPERIMENTAL! Works only with Chrome Canary at the moment.

WebGPU interactive implementation of lattice gas.
All calculations are performed on GPU so it can handle huge
amount of particles.

Deployed [here](https://www.golova.dev/automata/gasomatonGPU)

Based on skeeto's GOL [project](https://github.com/skeeto/webgl-game-of-life)
Check also his [article](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2014/06/10/) about two
texture approach for a WebGL automata implementation.

Basic rules and coloring borrowed from https://github.com/timhutton/latticegas.
